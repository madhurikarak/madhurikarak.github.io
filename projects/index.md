**[Data Dialogues: Season 2 ](https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/data-dialogue-seasons/season-2)**

A narrative long form 6-episode podcast I conceptualized, directed, and hosted as Science Communications Fellow at the [Open Environmental Data Project](https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/) between Oct 2022 and Jan 2023. 

The _Data Dialogues_ podcast brings together multiple perspectives to look at a single environmental data issue. The second season focuses on Indonesia’s OneMap policy: a decade-long, ongoing effort to resolve land conflict with data. I spoke to _adat_ elders, drone ecologists, journalists, lawyers, community mapping networks, data technologists, policy folks, and a multi-species ethnographer about the limitations of modern cartography, Indonesia's place in the international climate finance ecosystem, and Indigenous struggles over being seen.

**[At the Confluence of Digital Rights & Climate Justice](https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/)**

With [The Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/), I co-authored a landscape analysis of intersections between digital rights and environmental and climate justice to strengthen open collaboration over questions of digital safety, disinformation, extractive green technologies, rights of access, and sustainable internet. We spoke to practitioners, grantmakers, and scholars from 10+ countries. The report was published in July 2022.

Environmental Defense Fund's **[Small-Scale Fisheries Hub ](https://ssfhub.org/)**

As the Hub's Online Community Building Strategist, I led audience development research and designed a [playbook](https://github.com/madhurikarak/madhurikarak.github.io/files/10979540/SSF.Hub.Engagement.Playbook.Spring.2022.pdf) for driving engagement on coastal adaptation strategies; built  trust with partner organizations; and facilitated events via the Hub, a multilingual global network for artisanal fishers, fish workers, and their allies.

**['If you build it, will they come?'](https://behavior.rare.org)**

[Rare](https://rare.org/)'s Center for Behavior & the Environment 

Built, grown, and managed an emergent virtual community of practice  at the interface between behavioral insights and human-centered design. Sustained engagement through quarterly content and marketing calendars, with an emphasis on ensuring linguistic inclusivity and web accessibility for differently abled users. Annual recruitment drive ended with 1400+ members from 79 countries.

Conducted remote UX research sprints via usability testing and in-depth interviews to identify international users’ pain points, directly resulting in a set of user interface redesign solutions that increased unique page views across the learning platform by 210%.

Led the concept, research, interaction design, and wireframing of a ‘Behavior Change Toolkit for Agriculture’ with Marketing and Digital teams - a virtual behavior-centered design approach to solving four agricultural problems with the greatest climate mitigation potential.
